# 3.2.11: LAB - The continue statement – the Pretty Vowel Eater

#       Scenario
# Your task here is even more special than before: you must redesign the (ugly) vowel eater from the previous lab and create a better, 
# upgraded (pretty) vowel eater! Write a program that uses:
#     a for loop;
#     the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
#     the continue statement.

# Your program must:
#     ask the user to enter a word;
#     use user_word = user_word.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about string methods and the upper() method very soon - don't worry;
#     use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;
#     assign the uneaten letters to the word_without_vowels variable and print the variable to the screen.

# Look at the code in the editor. We've created word_without_vowels and assigned an empty string to it. Use concatenation operation to ask Python to 
# combine selected letters into a longer string during subsequent loop turns, and assign it to the word_without_vowels variable.

# Test your program with the data we've provided for you.

# TEST DATA
# INPUT DATA    Gregory         EXPECTED OUTPUT     GRGRY
# INPUT DATA    abstemious      EXPECTED OUTPUT     BSTMS
# INPUT DATA    IOUEA           EXPECTED OUTPUT     


word_without_vowels = ""
# Prompt the user to enter a word
user_word = input("Enter with the test word: ")
# and assign it to the user_word variable.
user_word = user_word.upper()

for letter in user_word:
    # Complete the body of the for loop.
    if letter == "A":
        continue
    elif letter == "E":
        continue
    elif letter == "I":
        continue
    elif letter == "O":
        continue
    elif letter == "U":
        continue
    else:
        word_without_vowels = word_without_vowels + letter

# Print the word assigned to word_without_vowels.
print(word_without_vowels)
